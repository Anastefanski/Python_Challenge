Python Homework
The homework assigned is to do two data analyses using Python. The first is an assignment labeled PyBank, where you perform a financial analysis showing the profit and losses of a bank. The second is an assignment labeled PyPoll, where you help a small town modernize its vote counting process.

# PyBank
Using the budget_data.csv file, calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#PyPoll
Using the election_data.csv file, calculate each of the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
